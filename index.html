i wish you would show up unannounced despite my desire to honor this season of my life that is making a hermit out of me. i wish you never stopped fighting for me, or for us. i wish we could go get tacos at that 24/7 hour spot. i wish i could call you to let you know that i had my very first burrito, a “California” one at that, and hear you beaming with pride on the other end of the line. i wish i could send you songs directly instead of making a playlist that i hope you’ll find. i wish we could share a pint of ice cream at 2 in the morning like we used to after having sex. i wish you could help me with my crossword puzzles again. i wish my toothbrush still had a cup-mate. i wish i didn’t have to sonically piece together the fragments of my disappointment, frustration, and resignation and could work through them with you instead. i wish you would text me, “30 out,” coming back to mine to find me in my dimly lit room, chipping away at my microbiology problem sets with a sheet mask on. i wish i could study in the corner while you played pool; you stealing kisses from me in between racks and me getting distracted by your accuracy and determined concentration. i wish you didn’t disappear when the going got tough - because no matter how hard it got for me, i could’ve never left you the way that you left me. i wish you had the humility, vulnerability, and strength to tell me everything that you wanted to instead of living up to your self-proclaimed moniker. i wish you were still the primary recipient of my inner dialogue. i wish you turned out to be a man of your word. i wish you stayed long enough to reap the fruits of your patience and devotion flourish (the tomatoes were particularly ripe with a particular hopefulness of balsamicy sunshine). i wish that i could cook us dinner (maybe with said tomatoes). i wish you would call me out the blue: “you mean the world to me and i cannot fathom living in it without you; i refuse to loose you, please, let’s work this out as a team.” i wish so much that you trusted me more. i wish we were more forgiving and optimistic with one another. i wish we could’ve slow danced to the playlist that i made us. i wish you were here for my 25th birthday to blow out my birthday candles with me so that i wasn’t utterly alone and in tears when i did so. i wish that you still adored me like you once did before i went down my slippery slope of self abandonment. i wish we could go get sushi together at the place where it’s always someones birthday. i wish you would memorize the contours of my neck with your lips until i believed that i was truly worthy of your affection and desire. i wish you still had skin in the game like you once did until you started to feel like you had left yourself too much too exposed. i wish you had let me finish dressing your wound, instead choosing to pick at the the stitches and tugging on the bloodied gauze, unwilling to release the familiarity of pain. i wish you actually developed the habit of coming to me with the things that broke and hardened your heart so that maybe that added layer of contextual understanding would’ve given us another point of compassionate understanding. i wish you could’ve put stock in all that i had done for and given to you instead of focusing so intently on everything that i hadn’t. i wish you could’ve seen how keeping-the-score was a foolish mans game. I wish i could understand why it was so easy for you to walk away. i wish i could grasp how you easy it was for you to light me on fire, put me out, and toss me asides like your old Newport habit. i wish you had the ability to get out of your own head and see the bigger picture. i wish we were still in that picture, together.
