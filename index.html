    i wish you would show up unannounced despite my desire to honor this season of my life that is making a hermit out of me. i wish you never stopped fighting for me, or for us. i wish we could go get tacos at that 24/7 hour spot. i wish i could call you to let you know that i had my very first burrito, a “California” one at that, and hear you beaming with pride on the other end of the line. i wish i could send you songs directly instead of making a playlist that i hope you’ll find. i wish we could share a pint of ice cream at 2 in the morning like we used to after having sex. i wish you could help me with my crossword puzzles again. i wish my toothbrush still had a cup-mate. i wish i didn’t have to sonically piece together the fragments of my disappointment, frustration, and resignation and could work through them with you instead. i wish you would text me, “30 out,” coming back to mine to find me in my dimly lit room, chipping away at my microbiology problem sets with a sheet mask on. i wish i could study in the corner while you played pool; you stealing kisses from me in between racks and me getting distracted by your accuracy and determined concentration. i wish you didn’t disappear when the going got tough - because no matter how hard it got for me, i could’ve never left you the way that you left me. i wish you had the humility, vulnerability, and strength to tell me everything that you wanted to instead of living up to your self-proclaimed moniker. i wish you were still the primary recipient of my inner dialogue. i wish you turned out to be a man of your word. i wish you stayed long enough to reap the flourishing fruits of your exhausted patience and honeyed-devotion (the tomatoes were hopefully ripe with the summering of balsamicy sunshine). i wish that i could cook us dinner (maybe with said tomatoes). i wish you would call me out the blue: “you mean the world to me and i cannot fathom living in it without you; i refuse to loose you, please, let’s work this out as a team.” i wish so much that you trusted me more. i wish we were more forgiving and optimistic with one another. i wish we could’ve slow danced to the playlist that
